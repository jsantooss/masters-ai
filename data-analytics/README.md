# Data Analytics ðŸ¤–

The main objective of the Data Analysis course is to present a set of techniques and methodologies based on
deep neural networks to solve real data analysis problems. Understanding the potential of these systems
and the ability to develop architectures with these characteristics gave me a set of specialized skills
to work in the area of computational data analysis. The main learning objectives of this course are:

1. Deep Neural Networks

2. Convolutional networks for computer vision

3. Recurrent networks

4. Natural language processing

5. Transformers

6. Reinforcement learning

7. Generative models

8. Application of TensorFlow, Keras and Hugging Face in the development of deep neural networks
